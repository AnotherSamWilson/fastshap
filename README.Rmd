## fastshap: A fast, approximate shap kernel

<a href='https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceforest'><img src='https://i.imgur.com/nbrAQso.png' align="right" height="300" /></a>

Calculating shap values can take an extremely long time. `fastshap` was designed to be as fast as possible, using numpy. This is done by utilizing inner and outer batch assignments to keep the calculations inside vectorized operations as often as it can. 

A kernel explainer is ideal in situations where:  

1) The model you are using does not have model-specific methods available (for example, support vector machine)
2) You need to explain a modeling pipeline which includes variable transformations.
3) You wish to explain the raw probabilities in a classification model, instead of the log-odds.


**WARNING**
This package specifically offers a kernel explainer, which can calculate approximate shap values of f(X) towards y for any function f. Much faster shap solutions are available specifically for gradient boosted trees.


### Installation
This package can be installed using pip:

``` {bash INSTALL1,eval=FALSE}
# Using pip
$ pip install fastshap --no-cache-dir
```

You can also download the latest development version from this
repository. If you want to install from github with conda, you 
must first run ```conda install pip git```.

``` {bash INSTALL2,eval=FALSE}
$ pip install git+https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/fastshap.git
```  
  
  
### Basic Usage  
We will use the iris dataset for this example. Here, we load the data and train a simple lightgbm model on the dataset:
``` {python iris}
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd
import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np

# Define our dataset and target variable
data = pd.concat(load_iris(as_frame=True,return_X_y=True),axis=1)
data.rename({"target": "species"}, inplace=True, axis=1)
data["species"] = data["species"].astype("category")
target = data.pop("sepal length (cm)")

# Train our model
dtrain = lgb.Dataset(data=data, label=target)
lgbmodel = lgb.train(
    params={"seed": 1, "verbose": -1},
    train_set=dtrain,
    num_boost_round=10
)

# Define the function we wish to build shap values for.
model = lgbmodel.predict

preds = model(data)
```

We now have a `model` which takes a Pandas dataframe, and returns predictions. We can create an explainer that will use `data` as a background dataset to calculate the shap values of any dataset we wish:

``` {python KernelExplainer}
import fastshap

ke = fastshap.KernelExplainer(model, data)
sv = ke.calculate_shap_values(data, verbose=False)

print(all(preds == sv.sum(1)))
```


### Stratifying the Background Set
We can select a subset of our data to act as a background set. By stratifying the background set on the results of the model output, we will usually get very similar results, while decreasing the caculation time drastically.
``` {python Stratify}
ke.stratify_background_set(5)
sv2 = ke.calculate_shap_values(
  data, 
  background_fold_to_use=0,
  verbose=False
)

print(np.abs(sv2 - sv).mean(0))
```

What we did is break up our background set into 10 different sets, stratified by the model output. We then used the first of these sets as our background set. We then compared the average difference between these shap values, and the shap values we obtained from using the entire dataset.


### Choosing Batch Sizes

If the entire process was vectorized, it would require an array of size (`# Samples * # Coalitions * # Background samples`, `# Columns`). Where `# Coalitions` is the sum of the total number of coalitions that are going to be run. Even for small datasets, this becomes enormous. `fastshap` breaks this array up into chunks by splitting the process into a series of batches.

This is a list of the large arrays and their maximum size:  

* Global  
  + Mask Matrix (`# Coalitions`, `# Columns`) dtype = `int8`
* Outer Batch  
  + Linear Targets (`Total Coalition Combinations`, `Outer Batch Size`, `Output Dimension`) dtype = `adaptive`
* Inner Batch  
  + Model Evaluation Features (`Inner Batch Size`, `# Background Samples`) dtype = `adaptive`

The `adaptive` datatypes of the arrays above will be matched to the data types of the `model` output. Therefore, if your model returns `float32`, these arrays will be stored as `float32`. The final, returned shap values will also be returned as the datatype returned by the model.

These theoretical sizes can be calculated directly so that the user can determine appropriate batch sizes for their machine:
``` {python batch_size}
# Combines our background data back into 1 DataFrame
ke.stratify_background_set(1)
(
    mask_matrix_size, 
    linear_target_size, 
    inner_model_eval_set_size
) = ke.get_theoretical_array_expansion_sizes(
    outer_batch_size=150,
    inner_batch_size=150,
    n_coalition_sizes=3,
    background_fold_to_use=None,
)

print(
  np.product(linear_target_size) + np.product(inner_model_eval_set_size)
)
```

For the iris dataset, even if we sent the entire set (150 rows) through as one batch, we only need 92100 elements stored in arrays. This is manageable on most machines. However, this number ***grows extremely quickly*** with the samples and number of columns. It is highly advised to determine a good batch scheme before running this process.



### Specifying a Custom Linear Model

Any linear model available from sklearn.linear_model can be used to calculate the shap values. If you wish for some sparsity in the shap values, you can use Lasso regression:
``` {python Lasso}
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

# Use our entire background set
ke.stratify_background_set(1)
sv_lasso = ke.calculate_shap_values(
  data, 
  background_fold_to_use=0,
  linear_model=Lasso(alpha=0.1),
  verbose=False
)

print(sv_lasso[0,:])
```

The default model used is `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.


### Multiclass Outputs

If the model returns multiple outputs, the resulting shap values are returned as an array of size (`rows`, `columns + 1`, `outputs`). Therefore, to get the shap values for the effects on the second class, you need to slice the resulting shap values using `shap_values[:,:,1]`. Here is an example:
```{python Multiclass}
multi_features = pd.concat(load_iris(as_frame=True,return_X_y=True),axis=1)
multi_features.rename({"target": "species"}, inplace=True, axis=1)
target = multi_features.pop("species")

dtrain = lgb.Dataset(data=multi_features, label=target)
lgbmodel = lgb.train(
    params={"seed": 1, "objective": "multiclass", "num_class": 3, "verbose": -1},
    train_set=dtrain,
    num_boost_round=10
)
model = lgbmodel.predict

explainer_multi = fastshap.KernelExplainer(model, multi_features)
shap_values_multi = explainer_multi.calculate_shap_values(multi_features, verbose=False)

# To get the shap values for the second class:
print(shap_values_multi[:,:,1].shape)
```
